# Bored of normal Minecraft?

Then challenge yourself or your friends to beat the Ender Dragon with Ultimate Randomizer! Ultimate Randomizer is a simple Minecraft plugin that randomizes block and Mob drops, while being highly configurable.


# Features

- every block drops a new random item. Some blocks could drop the same item, while others could drop nothing. The dropped amount can be configured in the config
- mobs drop random items as well! Drop chances stay the same for each mob
- mobs also drop a random amount of experience, configurable in the config
- a timer starts when you start the randomizer. This can be disabled in the config
- customize and translate the plugin messages
- a shuffle command to re-randomize all block and mob drops
- a player list so that only specific players are affected by the randomizer (disabled by default in the config)
